- Create a new Driver for MSSQL connectivity
- Somes part of code are fixing for the new driver for mssql.
- A new parameter are added for ODBConnection::query() called $tbname because in the
	php_mssql extension are not present the function mssql_field_table, similar to 
	mysql_field_table and pg_field_table. Now, the table name is $tbname parameter, 
	with this parameter we implemented an abstract functionlity for the programmers.

- Optimization of ODBObject::setDataFromArray
  The cicle 
	... foreach ($this->getPublicProperties() as $key => $value) { ...
  was changed by
        ...
        $public_prop = $this->getPublicProperties();
        foreach ($public_prop as $key => $value) {
        ...
  for most performance.
- Optimization of ODBObject::save
  -- similar as ODBObject::setDataFromArray
- Fix bug of method ODBObject::save
   Code:
        if ($this->isSaved()) { // update object
            $sql = "UPDATE " . $this->getTableName() . " SET ";
            foreach ($this->getPublicProperties() as $key => $value)
                $sql .= "$key='$value', ";

            $where = " WHERE {$this->getTableKeyName()} = {$this->getSQLIdValue()} ";
        }
   Replace with:
        if ($this->isSaved()) { // update object
            $sql = "UPDATE " . $this->getTableName() . " SET ";
            $i = 1;
            foreach ($public_properties as $key => $value)
                $sql .= (($i++ > 1)?",":"")."$key='$value' ";

            $sql .= " WHERE {$this->getTableKeyName()} = {$this->getId()} ";
        }

  Now, SQL code are correct!
